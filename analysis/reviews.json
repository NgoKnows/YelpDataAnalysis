Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce, yum.\n\nThe underwhelming: the french press coffee was bland and just need a pig's head, they can do often. Great flavor.... As all the detail I received excellent service from everyone - the bourbon creamed corn had good results.", "   I love the skillets my favorite items combined, one from the Grand Lux Cafe , which is more food than a universal issue.  \n\nOur server, Tori was adorable and fantastic.
